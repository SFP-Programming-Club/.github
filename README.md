# Welcome to the SFP Programming Club
We are SFP's premier club for all things computer science, programming, and tech in general. 
All grade levels are invited to join our thriving community of tech enthusiasts & problem solvers.

## Key Focuses
Check out some of our projects [here!](https://github.com/orgs/SFP-Programming-Club/repositories)

### Teaching
You don't need to know anything about computer science to join Programming Club!
Simply show up to a meeting, and our experienced leaders teach you the basics of programming in python. 
Withing a few weeks, you'll know enough to get a kickstart on your own projects, where you can learn even more skills. 

### Game Development
The majority of our members currently work on game development, creating their own content on the GameMaker game engine. 
Several complete games are made every year, with original art, gameplay elements, and more!

### Web Development
In 2023-2024, we created a backend video database and standardization tool that will soon be in use with the Fitness Center.
Many of our members create websites and other web-related technologies using tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring their ideas to life.

### UNIX and Operating Systems
Several members of the club are currently interested in UNIX-based Operating Systems and related technologies. 
We learn about using Linux on a daily basis, managing servers and other shared computers, and writing code for Unix OSes.
